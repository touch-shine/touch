              The UV rays have the ability to oxidize the paint of your car hence the car will appear dull and lifeless. Being constantly exposed to direct sunlight fades the paint, whereas the dust which is in the air may serve as a rough material, just like a sandpaper, leaving small scratches, but after a small period of time, the number of these scratches grows enormously. Even when the dirt is not too clean, it can etch the clear coat too hence permanent blemishes that require paint correction for cars.
It is not all about the beauty, clogging of the vents and filters with dust may affect your car performance. It is not only sensible but also mandatory to keep your car out of the reach of extreme weather.
