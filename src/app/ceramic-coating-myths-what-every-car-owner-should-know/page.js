              One big myth is that ceramic coatings completely stop scratches.
              This is untrue. Coatings are resistant to light scratches but not
              deep or hard ones. They enhance paint by forming a protective
              barrier but cannot work like bulletproof armor. Regular car
              maintenance remains vital to keep your car’s paint flawless.
              Cleaning it gently and avoiding rough objects protects the coating
              effectively. Recognizing this limitation assists in establishing
              realistic expectations for vehicle owners.
            </p>
            <p className="mt-2">
              Scratches frequently happen due to incorrect washing methods or
              unintentional contact with rough surfaces. These risks persist
              even when a ceramic coating is applied. To minimize the risk of
              scratches, always utilize microfiber cloths and pH-neutral
              detergents. These items provide gentle cleaning, maintaining both
              the finish and your vehicle's paint.{" "}

              Another false claim is that ceramic coatings make washing
              unnecessary. Dirt still sticks. The coating reduces how much grime
              sticks but does not eliminate the need for cleaning. Regular
              washing remains essential for preserving the shine and health of
              your car’s surface. Always use gentle soaps that support{" "}

            <p className="mt-2">
              Regular cleaning stops substances such as bird droppings or tree
              sap from penetrating the coating. These substances are acidic and
              can compromise the protective layer if left untreated. Washing
              your car weekly or as needed ensures the long-lasting shine and
              effectiveness of the coating.

              Nothing lasts forever, including ceramic coatings. They offer
              excellent durability but eventually fade. Environmental factors
              like sunlight, rain, and pollution gradually wear them down.
              Following proper car maintenance routines extends their life.
              Waxing over the coating or using recommended sealants can improve
              protection. Consistent upkeep ensures your investment remains
              worthwhile
            </p>
            <p className="mt-2">
              Ceramic coatings normally last between two to five years,
              depending on usage and care. Applying a maintenance spray designed
              for ceramic coatings can further enhance durability and
              performance.
